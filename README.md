## Notes

- The shortcut contains a pre-devined prompt to let ChatGPT know how to respond to questions and limit the length of the response.
- The shortcut does not use any loop to create a continuous conversation because the current version of the ChatGPT app does not cache previous queries. 
- The shortcut does not display any alert messages which could be persistant and could not be hidden automatically.
